* My Dot Files Repo
In this repo I store all my dotfiles from my home folder. I use windows so it only has the bashrc and the zshrc.

* DT's bare Repo video
This repo is actually a bare repository rather than a normal one which makes use of git in the home folder possible.

I hope this will be helpful if you want to create your own git bare repository.
